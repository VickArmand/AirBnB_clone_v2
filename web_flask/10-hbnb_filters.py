"""
script that starts a Flask web application:
    Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
    You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine
    (FileStorage or DBStorage)
    To load all cities of a State:
        If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
        Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
    After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
        Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
        Call in this method storage.close()
    Routes:
        /hbnb_filters: display a HTML page like 6-index.html,
        which was done during the project 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
            Copy files 3-footer.css, 3-header.css, 4-common.css and
            6-filters.css from web_static/styles/ to the
            folder web_flask/static/styles
            Copy files icon.png and logo.png from
            web_static/images/ to the folder web_flask/static/images
            Update .popover class in 6-filters.css to allow scrolling
            in the popover and a max height of 300 pixels.
            Use 6-index.html content as source code for the template
            10-hbnb_filters.html:
                Replace the content of the H4 tag under each filter title
                (H3 States and H3 Amenities) by &nbsp;
            State, City and Amenity objects must be loaded from DBStorage and
            sorted by name (A->Z)
    You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
